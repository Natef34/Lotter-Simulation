# Lotter-Simulation
This is a homework assignment from my CSCI161 class
The aim of this program is to demonstrate the terrible odds one has when playing the lottery (based on real-world average win rate). Player receives $100 to buy as many $1 lottery tickets as they would like and their winnings are returned to them to continue playing if they would like.

This is run like a real lottery. The user gets 6 random numbers for each ticket which is matched up against the computer's random 6 numbers.
Match         Prize
3 numbers     $3
4 numbers     $50
5 numbers     $2,000
6 numbers     $20,000,000
