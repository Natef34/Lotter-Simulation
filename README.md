# Lottery-Simulation
This is a homework assignment from my CSCI161 class
The aim of this program is to demonstrate the terrible odds one has when playing the lottery (based on real-world average win rate). Player receives $100 to buy as many $1 lottery tickets as they would like and their winnings are returned to them to continue playing if they would like.

This is run like a real lottery. The user gets 6 random numbers for each ticket which is matched up against the computer's random 6 numbers.
Match 3 numbers, win $3

Match 4 numbers, win $50

Match 5 numbers, win $2,000

Match 6 numbers, win $20,000,000
